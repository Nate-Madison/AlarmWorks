How it Started:
	Our website started out like most others. The first step was to find a business that needed a professional website. Kevin Basham, owner of Alarm Works, stood out to us mostly because of his successful business lacked such a fundamental tool: a website. Knowing we could help produce a website we offered our services and he gladly cooperated in giving all the information we needed to get started. 

Design:
	As you will notice when viewing our website, we stuck to the purple and yellow color scheme consistent with the company. The background image is a street view of the company headquarters. The logo, that has been used on signs to promote Alarm Works, was digitized to be included with the website. We even included aspects of this same logo to create our own favicon. The font that we chose resembles their original font for their logo. The font is called Montesserat.

Process:
	Alarm works is a security system that relies heavily on technology. Knowing this, our team wanted to make sure that the website we created represented the professional mood of the company. Part of this meant ensuring the website looked good on all devices. In today's world, it is likely that this website would be viewed from smart phones, tablets, and computers of all different sizes. Therefore, we included many different sizes when fitting the website to be responsive. By using several media queries, we were able to make the website both extremely functional and aesthetically pleasing on devices of all sizes. 

Responsiveness:
	The website uses the mobile-first approach to responsiveness. It is designed to look the best at any screen size, including ones larger than what we designed the website on. We ironed out any bugs or glitches that we found when coding the responsiveness of our website.
	
Logo:
	The logo is the logo that Alarm Works designed themselves. A picture was taken of one of the Alarm Works signs to get the base of the logo. We then had to clean and refine the logo so that is would have a neat and professional appearance. The .png of the logo was then converted to .svg to make loading times of the logo faster and so it would look good at all screen sizes.

Favicon:
	The favicon is designed to have the look of the original logo without having to be compressed. The arcs were taken from the original logo to maintain a familiar appearance. 

Home Page:
	The home page includes many of the things we believe their customers would be looking for at a quick glance. A customer can easily see the location as well as hours of operation the moment they open the site. Contact information is easily accessible as well as links towards the contact page.

About Page:
	The about page describes the Alarm Works business and tells a little bit about the business founder and owner, Kevin Basham. 

Pricing Page:
	The pricing page describes their unique pricing technique to ensure a customer's money is well spent. 

Contact Page:
	The contact page provides all means of communication a customer may use to contact Alarm Works. A form is also included as means to contact the company without having to leave the website.

Testimonials Page:
	The testimonials page provides future customers proof of customer satisfaction from former clients who enjoyed their experience working with Alarm Works.

Location Page:
	The location page contains a short cut that provides directions from whatever address you enter. A map is also included on the page. 

Header:
	The header includes the Alarm Works logo, an .svg file that links to the home page of the website. Also, links to each page of the website are included in the fixed header to remain at the top of your desktop at all times.

Footer: 
	The footer includes any information that should be easily accessible at any given moment. Some simple contact information, standard hours of operation, and a copyright are all included in the footer. We also included navigation to each page of the website consistent with that of the header inside the footer. 



In the end, we believe we have created a website that not only provides all information a potential customer would be looking for, but also maintained the high reputation Alarm Works has acquired through years of hard work and satisfied customers. We hope that our website will add to the success of an already thriving business.
